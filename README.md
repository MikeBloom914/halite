My Halite III bot

Halite is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by Two Sigma, 
where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board.

I competed in Halite 3 against an average exerienced coder of 3.5 years when I was at 4 months.
I earned the brownze award.

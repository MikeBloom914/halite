My Halite III bot

I earned the brownze award.

Halite is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by Two Sigma, 
where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board.

I competed in Halite III tournament as one of my final projects at Byte Academy.

I put up all different versions of my bot, with each one exponentially having a higher winning percentage.
